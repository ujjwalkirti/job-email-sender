                <p>
                Greetings! I am Ujjwal Kirti, a passionate software developer from India,
                currently immersing myself in the world of React Native development.
                </p>

                <p>
                One of my notable projects was for a local sporting event, where I
                conceptualized, designed, and led the development of a server-side
                rendered web application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.<br/> The application
                was hosted on Vercel, handling over 1600 page requests per minute from
                more than 3000 active users during match hours. I implemented an admin
                panel with Firebase's real-time database, enabling authorized volunteers
                to update match statistics, player and team stats, and other game data in
                real-time. This project was instrumental in attracting significant
                sponsorships and garnered substantial SEO traction.
                </p>

                <p>
                I've completed the web development bootcamp by Colt Steele from Udemy and
                am looking to build scalable systems using the latest technologies. I
                believe that working under your mentorship could provide me with
                invaluable experience and knowledge.
                </p>

                    <p>Hi ${receiverName},</p>

                    <p>
                      I hope this message finds you well. My name is <strong>Ujjwal Kirti</strong>, and I’m reaching out with a sincere request and strong motivation. I am a self-taught full-stack developer and budding DevOps engineer, deeply committed to growing into an exceptional professional in the DevOps domain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Recently, I’ve been working as a <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> at a fast-paced startup where I was solely responsible for designing and implementing the entire DevOps infrastructure from the ground up — despite having no formal background in the field. I taught myself every concept, tool, and best practice by doing, failing, and iterating.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Built production and development environments from scratch, provisioning a <strong>bare-metal server</strong> with <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Nginx</strong>, and hardened static IP configurations.</li>
                      <li>Set up fully automated CI/CD pipelines using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> that enabled seamless and reliable deployments with rollback safety.</li>
                      <li>Achieved <strong>99.9% uptime</strong> and reduced infrastructure costs significantly through optimization and continuous monitoring.</li>
                      <li>Streamlined development workflows and onboarded new developers with zero downtime, improving team velocity and reducing errors.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Before this, I worked at an immigration-tech company as a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> where I consistently went above and beyond. I architected a hybrid multi-cloud deployment strategy, delivered complex features end-to-end, and even built a Chrome extension to automate internal operations. My managers trusted me with core responsibilities early on because of my ability to learn fast, deliver reliably, and take ownership.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      What makes me different? I’ve learned everything from the ground up — no bootcamps, no paid courses — just curiosity and relentless effort. I’ve built and deployed full-stack projects on my own, and I’m deeply passionate about scaling, automation, and reliability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I’m writing to humbly ask for a shot: a <strong>junior DevOps role</strong> at your startup. I know experience is what most employers seek—but it’s exactly what I’m striving to gain. I’m confident I can deliver, adapt quickly, and never stop improving.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      If you're open to a conversation, I’d love to share more about what I’ve done and where I aim to go. Even if you don’t have an immediate opening, I’d be grateful to stay in touch for any future opportunities.
                    </p>

                    <p>Thank you so much for your time and consideration.</p>

                    <p>Warm regards,<br>
