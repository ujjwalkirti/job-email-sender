    <p>Dear</p>

    <p>
      Greetings! I am Ujjwal Kirti, a passionate software developer from India,
      currently immersing myself in the world of React Native development.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my notable projects was for a local sporting event, where I
      conceptualized, designed, and led the development of a
      <strong>server-side rendered web application</strong> using
      <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>.<br />
      The application was hosted on Vercel, handling over 1600 page requests per
      minute from more than 3000 active users during match hours. I implemented
      an admin panel with Firebase's real-time database, enabling authorized
      volunteers to update match statistics, player and team stats, and other
      game data in real-time. This project was instrumental in attracting
      significant sponsorships and garnered substantial SEO traction.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've completed the web development bootcamp by Colt Steele from Udemy and
      am looking to build scalable systems using the latest technologies. I
      believe that working under your mentorship could provide me with
      invaluable experience and knowledge.
    </p>
